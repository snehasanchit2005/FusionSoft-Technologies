In the field of neurology, PAMs are increasingly utilized to enhance cognitive function and address neurological disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease and schizophrenia. By modulating neurotransmitter receptors, these modulators can improve synaptic plasticity and neuronal communication, offering potential therapeutic benefits. Additionally, PAMs are gaining attention in psychiatry for their role in treating mood disorders like depression and anxiety. These modulators facilitate enhanced receptor response to endogenous neurotransmitters, potentially leading to improved mood regulation and reduced symptoms of these mental health conditions.</p><p>In the realm of oncology, PAMs are emerging as promising agents for cancer treatment. They work by modulating receptor activity to influence tumor growth and survival, thereby contributing to more effective cancer therapies. PAMs are also being explored in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, where their ability to modulate receptor activity can aid in managing conditions such as hypertension and heart failure. Furthermore, the application of PAMs in autoimmune diseases is an area of growing interest, as these modulators can potentially help in regulating immune responses and reducing inflammation. Overall, the diverse applications of PAMs across these therapeutic areas highlight their potential in addressing a range of medical conditions and driving market growth.</p></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Positive Allosteric Modulators Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>F.
